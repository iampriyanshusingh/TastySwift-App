# REDUX

- this is `not mandatory`.
- just like this `redux` there is another `justang` like thing to use.
- `react-redux` is older version of writing redux `(vanila redux)`.
- `react-toolkit` is newer version of writing redux `(RTK Query)`.
- it having part of the redux store, and it is known as `slices`.
- just suppose we have one button and we clicked on it and it `dispatches`an `action` and this `action will call the function` and it will be changed or do something we that.
- and this function is known as `reducer`.
